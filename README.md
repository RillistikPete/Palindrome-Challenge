# Palindrome-Challenge

You must write a program that reads user input (a number) and checks if it is a palindrome (by checking its reverse order).

Your program should output the number of iterations it took to compute the palindrome and the resulting palindrome.

Start with the number 195.


#### Example:


Reverse the number's digits and add it to the original input number. If the sum is not a palindrome, repeat this procedure.
Your output should look like the following:

```
4 9339
```
