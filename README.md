# Palindrome Challenge

You must write a program that reads user input (a number) and checks if it is a palindrome (by checking its reverse order).

Start with the number 195.

Reverse the number's digits and add it to the original input number. If the sum is not a palindrome, repeat this process.

Your program should output the number of iterations it took to compute the palindrome and the resulting palindrome.



### Example:

Iteration 1: 195 591 (Not a palindrome) Sum - 786

Iteration 2: 786 687...


Your output should look like the following:
```
4 9339
```
